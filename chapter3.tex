\section{The Basic Idea}\label{sec:conc_basic_idea}

The word "concolic" is a portmanteau of the words concrete and symbolic and it
depicts the hybrid nature of the concolic software testing technique. Concolic testing
interleaves concrete execution with symbolic execution in order to achieve high
path coverage. The basic idea is to use symbolic execution to generate inputs
that will hopefully steer the program to alternate execution paths whilst
concrete execution is used to guide the symbolic execution along a concrete
path.
